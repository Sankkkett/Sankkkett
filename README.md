# Hello! I'm Sanket Pawar. üëã

I'm an enthusiastic IT student and a **final-year B.Tech student** at **Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Lonere**, with a strong focus on Data Science. I enjoy working on projects that leverage data to drive meaningful insights and solve real-world problems.

## üöÄ What I Do

### ü§ñ Machine Learning
- Designing and training models for predictive analytics and natural language processing.

### üìä Data Analysis
- Transforming raw data into actionable insights using advanced statistical methods.

### üìà Data Visualization
- Creating compelling visualizations to communicate data-driven findings effectively.
- Building interactive dashboards and reports using **Power BI** to visualize complex data trends and insights for informed decision-making.

## üî≠ Projects

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Telecom Churn Dataset
- Extracted insights from datasets through visualization and statistical analysis.
- [Python | Pandas | Power BI | Numpy | Data Preprocessing] 
ÔÇ∑ Conducted a comprehensive preprocessing of telecom customer churn data using Python and Pandas. Removed unnecessary 
columns (e.g., Customer ID) and handled missing or incorrect data for better model performance. 
ÔÇ∑ Saved the cleaned and pre-processed dataset to a new CSV file for subsequent analysis, ensuring that the data was prepared 
for machine learning tasks such as churn prediction. Also used the Power BI to visualize the important insights.

### Toxic Sentiment Detection App
- Leveraged NLP techniques to identify toxic comments.
- Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

### Fake News Detection
- Developed a machine learning project to classify news articles as real or fake.
- [Python | Scikit-learn | NLP | Decision Tree | Streamlit] 
ÔÇ∑ Preprocessed a fake news dataset with NLP techniques (text cleaning, stemming, and TfidfVectorizer), optimizing data by 
removing unnecessary characters and stopwords for enhanced model accuracy.  
ÔÇ∑ Trained a Decision Tree classifier on the vectorized data, achieving an accuracy of 0.83 on the test set with training and test 
dimensions of (3750, 44771) and (1250, 44771), respectively. 

### Smart Resume Evaluator
- Designed a system to optimize applicant tracking and hiring processes.
- [Python | Streamlit | Google Generative AI | PDF Processing | NLP]   
ÔÇ∑ Developed a resume evaluation tool in Python and Streamlit, enabling users to upload resumes as PDFs, converted to 
images for further analysis. 
ÔÇ∑ Integrated Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5) to provide professional HR-style feedback and ATS analysis, assessing 
alignment with job descriptions. 
ÔÇ∑ Implemented two main features: a detailed HR review with strengths and weaknesses, and a percentage match indicating 
alignment, including missing keywords. 

### PAN Card Tampering Detection ‚Äì Document Authenticity Analysis and Anomaly Detection
- [Python | Streamlit | OpenCV | SSIM | FPDF] Github Repo 
ÔÇ∑ Developed an interactive application to detect tampering in PAN card images using OpenCV and SSIM for similarity 
scoring, with contour mapping to highlight altered regions. 
ÔÇ∑ Incorporated customizable threshold and color options for user-defined detection parameters in Streamlit. 
ÔÇ∑ Added downloadable PDF report containing SSIM scores, highlighted tampered areas, and quality improvement suggestions 
to enhance verification accuracy.

### Traffic and Accident Analysis 
- [MySQL | Power BI | Power Query | Excel] 
ÔÇ∑ Conducted an in-depth analysis of traffic and accident data using SQL, utilizing one main fact table linked with dimension 
tables in a STAR schema to structure the data effectively for analysis. 
ÔÇ∑ Pre-processed missing and erroneous data using SQL queries, ensuring data accuracy and reliability for analytical insights. 
ÔÇ∑ Leveraged Power BI visualization tools to present insights, using bar, line, and pie charts to reveal patterns in traffic 
volume, accident-prone zones, and times of peak congestion.
